This is it from the task. From the practical point of view, we have to consider the following points to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the model:
Continuously monitor the model's performance on a test dataset or in a real-world environment.
Collect feedback from end-users regarding false positives.
Use this feedback to understand the model's weaknesses and areas for improvement.
Deploy the model into production.
